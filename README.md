# WEB startkit

Prerequisites:

* tmux
* python-3.6
* pip
* node
* yarn

If you don't have/use CBSD/Reggae:

```
# bin/devel.sh
```

If you do use CBSD/Reggae, you should only run:
```
# echo 'DEVEL_MODE=YES' >vars.mk
# make devel
```

It will download backend and frontend repos for you and do the rest of the magic.
